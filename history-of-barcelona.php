			FC Barcelona was founded in 1899 in Catalonia, Spain. The team was founded by Swiss, English and Spanish footballers led by Joan Gamper in 1899. 
			Barcelona co-founded Laliga  in 1928, the top-tier in Spanish Football, a long with other clubs in Spain.  Since then, Barcelona has never been relegated
			from Laliga, a record they share with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. The blue and red barcelona  jersey was first worn in a match against Hispania
			in 1900. However, in 1902, the club won its first trophy and also losing 2 - 1 to Bizacaya in its first copa del rey final. Joan Gamper became Barcelona president
			in 1908 in order to save the club from bankruptcy. The club had not won since 1905 which causes financial problems. One of his biggest achievements
			was to help Barcelona build its own stadium and achieve a stable income. Jack Green Well was Barcelona's first full-time coach in 1917. In 1936,
			the Spanish Civil War began and several Barcelona players were enlisted as one of the people who will fought against the military uprising, a lot of lives
			where lost. In 1945, FC Barcelona won Laliga for the first time since 1929. They also won two more titles in 1948 and 1949. The Camp Nou Stadium was
			finished in 1957. Barcelona was the first club to beat Real Madrid in the European Cup play-off in 1961. However, they lost 2 - 3 to Benfica in the
			final. With Real Madrid monopolizing in Laliga and the completion of the Camp nou stadium, the 1960's were less successful for the club and which meant
			that the club had little money to spend on new players. Josep Lluis Nunez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona in 1978 - 2000 with the main
			objective of developing the club to be a world class team. In 2000 - 2003, Caspart took over as Barcelona coach which was a great disappointment led him to be replaced
			by Laporta (2003 - 2010) who brought in Ronaldinho to help Barcelona be back on track. From 2010 - 2013, Rosell was elected as the president of Barcelona.
			From 2013 to present, when Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of the complaint for alleged misappropriation of Neymar transfer in which 
			FiFa ban the club from buying players for the next two transfer windows for the voilation of FiFa rules of signing under 18 players led to his replacement
			by Josep Maria Bartomeu who close the deal in 2016. As of 2019, barcelona have qualified for Champions league quarter final facing Manchester United.
